          | What started as a dream to preserve family tradition has blossomed into something beautifully unexpected. We've watched first dates 
          | turn into engagements over our signature osso buco, celebrated countless birthdays and anniversaries, and welcomed regulars who have 
          | become extended family. Every sauce is still simmered with the same patience Nonna taught us, every pasta is rolled by hand, 
          | and every guest is welcomed like family walking through our front door.

          | We're not just serving dinner - we're continuing a conversation that 
          | started generations ago, one plate at a time. And every time you join us, you become part of that story too. Benvenuti alla famiglia 
          | - Welcome to the family.
